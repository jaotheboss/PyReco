Python recommendation system that does not rely on C-ython

## Motivation:
I started this project because I was looking for a recommendation system for Python. However, my search has led me to multiple systems that require the installation of Cython which does not sit well with my local computer. Therefore, I set out to code out a recommendation system without the need for Cython! 

## Description:
This module only requires modules that does not rely on C (in the sense that you don't need Cython). I've tried to emulate as much as the math as I could through the use of Numpy arrays. I have hence created 3 kinds of recommendation systems:
 
1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)
2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)
3. SVD Filtering
